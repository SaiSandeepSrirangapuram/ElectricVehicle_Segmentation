# Electric Vehicle Segmentation: A Data Science Approach

## Overview
This repository applies **data science methodologies** to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in India. By leveraging **machine learning algorithms**, we uncover key patterns in income-based and geographic segmentation, helping businesses optimize their EV marketing strategies.

## Contents
- **EV_Income_segmentation.ipynb**: Implementation of **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** and **K-Means clustering** for income segmentation.
- **Geographic_variable.ipynb**: Application of **hierarchical clustering** and feature engineering for geographic segmentation.
- **EV Segmentation (IncomeGroup).docx**: Strategic summary linking data insights to business recommendations.
- **India Household Spending raw_file.xlsx**: Raw dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection.
- **Grapical_Variables.pdf**: Data visualizations highlighting key segmentation variables.

## Data Science Techniques
This project utilizes:
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) & K-Means** for clustering income groups.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** for geographic analysis.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
- **Feature scaling & preprocessing** to improve clustering accuracy.
- **Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn** for actionable insights.
