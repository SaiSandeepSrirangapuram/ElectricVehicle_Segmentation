# Electric Vehicle Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains data analysis and segmentation strategies for electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India. The project leverages clustering techniques to identify target income groups and geographic segments that are most likely to adopt EVs.

## Contents
- **EV_Income_segmentation.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook analyzing income-based segmentation using clustering algorithms.
- **Geographic_variable.ipynb**: Notebook exploring geographic segmentation for EV adoption.
- **EV Segmentation (IncomeGroup).docx**: Document summarizing findings and strategic recommendations.
- **India Household Spending raw_file.xlsx**: Dataset containing household spending patterns relevant to EV adoption.
- **Grapical_Variables.pdf**: Visualization of key segmentation variables.

## Methodology
The project applies:
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for income segmentation.
- **Hierarchical clustering** for geographic segmentation.
- **Data preprocessing** techniques to refine feature scaling and clustering accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiSandeepSrirangapuram/ElectricVehicle_Segmentation.git
